# Call Center Operations Optimization_project 3

☎️ Call Center Operations Optimization
Simulation-based analysis of staffing, cost, and customer experience using queueing theory and event-driven simulations.

**🚀 Key Features**

Queueing Models (M/M/1, M/M/s): Analytical and simulation-based.

Poisson Arrivals & Exponential Service Times

Event-Based Simulation Over 8-Hour Shift

Customer Wait Time & Queue Tracking

Dynamic Staffing Optimization (1–5 agents)

Statistical Metrics: Average & 95th percentile wait, abandonment rates.

Cost Function Analysis: Labor vs. delay cost.

**🧠 Learning Outcomes**

Understand M/M/1 and M/M/s queueing systems

Implement discrete-event simulations

Measure and interpret key service metrics

Perform staff-size optimization under SLA constraints

Model real-world effects (breaks, patience, peak variation)

Make data-driven recommendations with cost and risk analysis

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Python – Core logic

NumPy – Random processes & math

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Plots & dashboards

Pandas – Simulation data analysis
